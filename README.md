**Summary**

Home Credit is currently using a variety of statistical and machine learning methods to predict credit scores. The objective is to unlock the full potential of the available data in order to ensure that customers who are capable of repayment are not rejected during the loan application process. Loans should be granted with appropriate principal amounts, maturities, and repayment schedules that motivate customers to successfully repay their obligations. The evaluation will be conducted based on the depth of understanding demonstrated in the analysis.

**Primary Goal**

To develop a credit scoring model that accurately predicts the probability of default for loan applicants, enabling better credit risk assessment.
